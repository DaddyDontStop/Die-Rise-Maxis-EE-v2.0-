Elevator and Dragon Puzzle along with the springpad count skip function for the Richtofen side were modified from shyperson0's script.

Elevators step and Dragon Puzzle: Require the same amount as the number of players. If the Dragon Puzzle step is failed, it will reset back to require the same amount as the number of players.

Maxis Trample Steam step: The players are able to obtain at least 4 trample steams from the equipment table during the Maxis Trample Steams step, but they must place one down before being able to equip the next one. (Disabled) Zombies will ignore your buildables during the step.  
Placing the balls:
- If the number of players is 2 or less, the players will have the ability to place both balls on the same set of Trample Steams.
- If the player is playing solo or 3p:
  - once the player picks up a ball, gives the player the ability to place the ball on an already correctly placed Trample Steam without needing a Trample Steam on the opposite end. On 3p, this is executed if the ball is picked up while there's already a ball flinging; and
  - once a player places a Trample Steam correctly, gives each player already carrying a ball the ability to place it without needing a Trample Steam on the opposite end. On 3p, this is executed if the Trample Steam is placed while there's already a ball flinging.  
(Note): on 3p while trying the methods when there isn't a Trample Steam on the opposite end, the player may need to place the ball back at the statue and pick it back up for the prompt to appear.

Remember, if you're doing the Maxis side, do NOT completely die or buy the galvaknuckles or bowie knife until the Maxis ballistic knife step is complete or the step will NOT progress. If you buy the Galvaknuckles or the Bowie Knife, you can get rid of it by downing while having Who's Who and letting your original self disappear.

Richtofen Trample Steam step: Requires the players to place Trample Steams only on the same amount of symbols as players.
