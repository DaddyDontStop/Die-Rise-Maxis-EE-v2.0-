# Die-Rise-Maxis-EE-v2.0-
Solo mod 

Elevator and Dragon Puzzle was done by shyperson0, along with the springpad count skip function. 

Trample Steam step: You are able to pick up 4 trample steams from the equipment table, but you must place each one down before you can equip the next one. 
This is buggy at its current state, in order for them to work correctly, you must place/pick up each of the trample steams a few (3) times BEFORE putting them down onto the lion symbols, otherwise they may be "OFF" and will not progress the EE. 
Hopefully myself or someone else improves this in the future. Zombies will ignore your buildables. 

Placing the balls: Place BOTH balls on the last trample steam you put on the lion spots. Ideally the spot in the spawn room. 

Remember, do NOT buy the galvaknuckles or bowie knife until the ballistic knife step is complete or the EE will NOT progress.
