Elevator and Dragon Puzzle along with the springpad count skip function for the Richtofen side were modified from shyperson0's script.

Elevators step and Dragon Puzzle: Require the same amount as the number of players. If the Dragon Puzzle step is failed, it will reset back to require the same amount as the number of players.

Maxis Trample Steam step: The players are able to obtain at least 4 trample steams from the equipment table during the Maxis Trample Steams step, but they must place one down before being able to equip the next one. Zombies will ignore your buildables during the step.
Placing the balls: If the number of players is 2 or less, the players will have the ability to place both balls on the same set of Trample Steams.

Richtofen Trample Steam step: Requires the players to place Trample Steams only on the same amount of symbols as players.

Remember, do NOT completely die or buy the galvaknuckles or bowie knife until the Maxis ballistic knife step is complete or the step will NOT progress. If you buy the Galvaknuckles or the Bowie Knife, you can get rid of it by downing while having Who's Who and letting your original self disappear.
