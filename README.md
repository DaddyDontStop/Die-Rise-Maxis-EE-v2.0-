Elevator and Dragon Puzzle along with the springpad count skip function for the Richtofen side were modified from shyperson0's script.

Remember, if you're doing the Maxis side, do NOT completely die or buy the galvaknuckles or bowie knife until the Maxis ballistic knife step is complete or the step will NOT progress. If you buy the Galvaknuckles or the Bowie Knife, you can get rid of it by downing while having Who's Who and letting your original self disappear.

### Elevators Step and Dragon Puzzle
Require the same amount as the number of players. If the Dragon Puzzle step is failed, it will reset back to require the same amount as the number of players.

### Trample Steam step:
#### Maxis Side
- (Disabled) If the number of players is less than 4, the players will be able to obtain at least 4 trample steams from the equipment table during the Maxis Trample Steams step, but they must place one down before being able to equip the next one. Zombies will ignore your buildables during the step.
- On solo and on 3p while the 1st ball is already flinging between Trample Steams placed on a set lion symbols, only one Trample Steam will be required in order to be able to place down a ball.
- If the number of players is 2 or less, the players will have the ability to place both balls on the same set of Trample Steams.
- On 3p, having the 1st ball flinging is required to be able to place the other ball on the lone Trample Steam.

#### Richtofen Side
Requires the players to place Trample Steams only on the same amount of symbols as players.
